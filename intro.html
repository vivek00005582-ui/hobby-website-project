    <h1>About This Project</h1>

    <p style="color:var(--muted); font-size:16px;">
        This website is created as a group project to highlight the hobbies, interests,
        and creative activities of our team members. Each member has their own unique set
        of hobbies that help them grow, relax, and improve different skills.
    </p>

    <p style="color:var(--muted); font-size:16px;">
        You can explore each member's introduction, hobby details, personal gallery, and
        contact information. The project is made entirely using simple HTML and CSS for
        easy understanding.
